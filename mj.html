        <p>There was no question that Air Jordan would end up on the first place on any all-time list. His aggressive nature, high flying dunks, wagging tongue, and the winning mindset is a legend in basketball.

            In his 1988 season, he won the NBA MVP, the Defensive Player of the Year, as well as the scoring title. Need I say more? He is regarded as not just an icon of basketball, but of all sporting history. There has never been a player like him. Going 6 of 6 at the biggest stage (NBA Finals), and winning two three-peats with the Chicago Bulls, the evidence is plenty.
            
            His championships have come against sides loaded with Hall of Famers. What he has done for the sport is unparalleled. Basketball would not be the same without him. Michael Jordan truly is the greatest of all time and is the best basketball player ever.</p>
