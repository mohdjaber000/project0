        <h1 class="font-weight-light">3rd Place - Lebron James</h1>
        <p>LeBron James has been constantly building his case for the "Greatest of all Time" tag. He has easily cemented his place within the top 3 NBA players in any list. What is scary is that he produced one of his best statistical seasons in his 15th season and despite injury troubles, he averaged 27.4 points, 8.3 assists and 8.5 rebounds in the last season (which was also his 16th in the league). His four regular season MVP honors and three NBA Finals MVP honors speak volumes about the value he adds to whichever team he is a part of. LeBron is undoubtedly the best basketball player in the world at the moment.

            In pure raw skill sets and overall completeness, there isn't any player greater than him. His lack of a greater number of championships is not a reason enough to place him any lower on this list. Enroute his several NBA Finals appearances, he has faced two outstanding dynasties: Popovich's Spurs and the Golden State Warriors. He also faced Kobe's Lakers and a dominant Celtics in the East during the regular season. No other player can claim to have held his own against so many dynasties.</p>
